				<h2>Robinson Crusoe At Home</h2>
				<article class="show-first">
					<p class="p1">When I was a little boy, I lived in a greatcity by the sea, with my father and mother.They were very kind to me and loved medearly. They wished me to go to schooland learn a great deal, so that I mightsome day be a useful man. But I was lazy, and liked better to playby the river than to study. I often sat hour after hour watching the great shipsloading and unloading their cargoes, andas they sailed away I wished I might gowith them.</p>
					<p class="p2">My father had told me that the shipscame from lands where the men did notlook like those I knew, and the plants andanimals were very different from any I hadseen.He expected me to become a merchant,but I could think of nothing but the ships,and I often ran away from my work to watch them.</p>
					<p class="p3">When I was sixteen years old, father saidto me one day: "Robinson, I wish you tobe a merchant. If you attend to your work,you shall seme day take charge of my busi-ness; but if you are lazy, no one will carefor you and you will not be able to care for yourself." He talked to me a long timeabout my bad habits.</p>

						I said: 'but father, I do not wish to be a merchant. I want to go away on one ofthose ships. It must be great fun to be out on the ocean, and I want to see those strangelands.'</p>

				<h2>The voyage</h2>
				<article class="show-first">
					<p class="p1">The ship on which I found myself, that bright September morning, was a large one.The sailors were getting it ready for the voyage. Soon I heard the cry, **A—allha—a—nds! up anchor, a—ho—oy! At once everything seemed to be filled with life; the sails were loosed, the yards braced,and the anchor slowly raised.</p>
					<p class="p2">Orders were given so rapidly and there was such a hurrying about and so many strange noises that I hardly knew what to make of it. The boom of a cannon was heard above the shouts of the sailors andthe creaking of the sails; then the vessel moved slowly out of the harbor. In a short time we were under way.</p>		
					<p class="p3">I turned to look at the home I was leaving. I could see the streets with the peo-ple passing up and down, the houses, andthe gardens. Soon I could see only the towers; finally they, too, faded from sight, and I was out on the great ocean.</p>

						<p>A strong wind arose, and the ship rocked so fearfully from side to side that I became dizzy. The storm grew worse, and I thought that every wave would surely swal-low up the ship. Every time it went down into the trough or hollow of the sea, I feared it would never come up again. I told my friend that I was very much afraid; but heonly laughed at me and said, 'Oh, you willget used to this after a little.'</p>

				<h2>Robinson in his new home</h2>
				<article class="show-first">
					<p class="p1">I began to wonder what I should do here. I was very wet and had no changeof clothes. I was hungry and thirsty and did not know where to look for food or drink. I was also afraid that wild animals might attack me, for I had no gun.</p>
					<p class="p2">It was growing dark and I must look fora safe place to sleep. Where should I find it? For some time I stood still, dazed and helpless, not knowing what to do. At last I said, 'I will do as the birds do, find a bed in a tree.' I soon found a treewith thick branches in which I could settlemyself quite comfortably and sleep withoutdanger of falling.</p>
